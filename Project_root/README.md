## Title: Design and prototype a solution that uses artificial intelligence to enhance data quality across heterogeneous systems.

### Background
As organizations increasingly rely on large-scale, distributed data platforms (e.g., Hadoop, Oracle, Snowflake), ensuring high data quality across systems has become both critical and challenging. Traditional methods of identifying and resolving data quality issues are often manual, reactive, and non-scalable.

#### Tools used: Python, Streamlit, Draw.io, Airflow, Docker
